# Normalization
In the requirements file, the ERD has already been normalized respecting 1NF, 2NF and 3NF
1NF: every table in the database has a primary key and its columns have atomic values
2NF: for each table the non-key columns depend on the whole primary key
3NF: there are not non-key attributes that depend transitively on the primary key
